## Problem Statement

Social media platforms have become deeply embedded in the daily lives of individuals, particularly among younger generations. While these platforms serve various positive functions such as communication, entertainment, and education, excessive and uncontrolled usage can lead to addictive behaviors, decreased productivity, and negative mental health outcomes. Despite growing awareness, many users underestimate the impact of their social media habits. This study investigates patterns of social media use, focusing on the degree of time-wasting and the prevalence of addiction among users.

---

## Dataset Description

The dataset used for this project is titled **"Time-Wasters & Addiction on Social Media"** and contains **1,000 objects** collected from users across different countries.
The dataset consists:

- **Demographics**  
  - `Age`  
  - `Gender`  
  - `Location`  
  - `Profession`  

- **Behavioral Data**  
  - `Platform` – Primary social media platform used (e.g., TikTok, YouTube)  
  - `Total Time Spent` – Daily time spent on social media (in minutes)  
  - `Frequency` – How often participants use social media (e.g., hourly, daily)  
  - `Number of Videos Watched` – Count of videos consumed per day  
  - `Video Category` – Type of content viewed (e.g., comedy, education, news)  

- **Device Usage**  
  - `DeviceType` – Device used for accessing social media (e.g., Mobile, Desktop)  
  - `Watch Time` – Time of day when social media is used (e.g., Morning, Night)  
  - `CurrentActivity` – Activity being disrupted or paralleled (e.g., studying, relaxing)  

- **Psychological Indicators**  
  - `Self Control` – Self-reported control over usage (scale 1–10)  
  - `Addiction Level` – Measured addiction score (scale 0–7)  

- **Motivational Factors**  
  - `Watch Reason` – Main motivation for usage (e.g., boredom, habit, entertainment)

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to analyze social media usage behavior and identify patterns linked to time-wasting and addiction. Using data visualization and statistical techniques in R, the analysis aims to:

- Identify key factors contributing to excessive social media usage
- Explore the relationship between usage time and addiction levels
- Understand the impact of social media on productivity and self-control
- Generate actionable insights and recommendations for healthier usage habits

---

## Research Questions

1. **Which social media platforms are most associated with excessive daily usage?**
2. **Is there a statistically significant correlation between the time spent on social media and users' self-reported addiction levels?**
3. **Does age group significantly influence the likelihood of experiencing social media addiction?**
4. **Has social media usage led to a perceived decrease in productivity or academic performance among users?**
5. **Can the addiction level be predicted based on time spent and number of platforms used?**
6. **Does an intervention or increased awareness lead to behavioral changes in usage patterns?**

- **Outliers** are primarily present in **'Video.Length'** and **'Number.of.Videos.Watched'**, which may skew averages and should be handled carefully during analysis.
- Self-reported variables like 'Self.Control' and 'Addiction.Level' show reasonable distribution and can be used for predictive analysis or regression.
- The distribution of **'Total.Time.Spent'** is wide but **lacks strong outliers**, suggesting consistent heavy usage across users.

```

```{r}
basic_dist_plots <- grid.arrange(age_plot, platform_plot, addiction_plot, time_plot, ncol = 2)
```


##### 1. Age Distribution
- The dataset includes users aged between **18 and 68 years**.
- The largest age groups are **20–25** and **40–45**, each with approximately **100 users**.
- This shows a **bimodal distribution**, indicating that both young adults and middle-aged individuals are highly engaged with social media.

##### 2. Platform Distribution
- **Instagram** leads with just over **220 users** selecting it as their primary platform.
- **TikTok** and **YouTube** are close behind, each with around **210–215 users**.
- **Facebook** has the lowest count at **~180 users**.
- This suggests that visual and short-form content platforms are more dominant in this user base.

##### 3. Addiction Level Distribution
- Addiction scores range from **0 to 9.5**, on a scale of 0–10.
- Most users cluster around:
  - **0.5–1.5** (approx. **150 users**)
  - **2.5–3.5** (approx. **200 users**)
  - **5.0–6.0** (approx. **200 users**)
- Very few users report extreme values (either very low or near 10).
- This implies a broad awareness of usage habits, with moderate levels of addiction being the most common.

##### 4. Total Time Spent Distribution
- Time spent on social media per day ranges from **0 to 300 minutes**.
- A noticeable peak appears around **50 minutes**, with **~50 users** in that bin.
- Usage is relatively uniform across other bins, showing diverse habits:
  - Light users (~30–60 minutes)
  - Moderate users (100–150 minutes)
  - Heavy users (200–300 minutes)
- This supports the idea that **social media engagement is widespread and variable**, making generalizations difficult without further segmentation.

```

```{r}
platform_comp_plots <- grid.arrange(platform_addiction, platform_time, platform_videos, ncol = 2)
```

These boxplots compare **Addiction Level**, **Total Time Spent**, and **Number of Videos Watched** across four major platforms: **Facebook**, **Instagram**, **TikTok**, and **YouTube**.

##### 1. Addiction Level by Platform

- YouTube shows a slightly higher **median addiction level**, suggesting longer engagement sessions may relate to stronger platform pull.
- All platforms have a **wide spread**, indicating diverse user behavior and perception of addiction.
- Outliers are present, showing users with addiction levels above 7–8.

##### 2.Total Time Spent by Platform

- Facebook users appear to spend slightly **more time** daily on average compared to others.
- All platforms exhibit **long tail distributions**, meaning some users are on them for **3–5+ hours daily**.
- The variability is high, particularly on Instagram and TikTok.

##### 3. Number of Videos Watched by Platform

- YouTube has slightly more users who consume **large numbers of videos**, as seen by outliers above 70.
- Despite TikTok’s reputation for endless short clips, YouTube users in this sample watch more videos on average.

##### Key Takeaways

- All platforms show **moderate addiction levels**, with **YouTube slightly higher** in both addiction and time spent.
- **Facebook users** spend the **most daily time** overall, which could be attributed to older demographics and passive browsing.
- **YouTube and Instagram** drive the **highest video consumption**, possibly due to autoplay features and short-form content.

This section analyzes how different platforms are used based on **user motivations**, **content preferences**, **watching time behavior**, and **gender distribution**.

##### 1. Watch Reason by Platform

- **Habit** is the **most cited reason** across all platforms:
  - Instagram users: ~80 respondents
  - YouTube users: ~65 respondents
  - Facebook & TikTok: ~60 each
- **Boredom** and **Entertainment** are also frequent reasons, especially among TikTok and Instagram users.
- **Procrastination** is less commonly cited (~30–40 users per platform), but still notable.

**Insight**: Social media is most often used out of **habit** and **entertainment needs**, implying habitual engagement rather than intentional use.

##### 2. Video Category by Platform

- **Most Watched Categories**:
  - **Jokes/Memes**: TikTok leads with ~45 users.
  - **Life Hacks** and **Gaming** are popular on Instagram and YouTube.
  - **ASMR** and **Vlogs** are evenly consumed across platforms (~20–30 users each).

**Insight**: Users gravitate toward light-hearted or practical content, and content preferences vary by platform—e.g., TikTok users favor memes, while YouTube sees more gaming and educational content.

##### 3. Watch Time by Platform

- **Wide time spread** with activity spanning **all 300 minutes**.
- Peaks between **0–60 minutes**, with Instagram and TikTok showing heavier early activity.
- **No clear time-of-day clusters** due to usage being aggregated over total time spent, not actual hour of day.

**Insight**: Users access platforms consistently throughout the day, though **high-frequency use in shorter bursts** is especially visible for short-form video apps like TikTok.

##### 4. Gender Distribution by Platform

- **Males dominate** usage on all platforms:
  - Male counts: 130–150 per platform
  - Female counts: 70–95 per platform
- The gap is most prominent on **Instagram and YouTube**

**Insight**: The dataset indicates a **gender imbalance**, which may affect addiction patterns, content preference, and platform usage style.

This bubble chart illustrates how **average time spent**, **average addiction level**, and **number of videos watched** vary across platforms:

- The **x-axis** represents **Average Time Spent (minutes)**.
- The **y-axis** represents **Average Addiction Level** (scale 0–10).
- **Bubble size** corresponds to the **number of videos watched**.
- **Bubble color** distinguishes platforms: Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube.

---

##### Key Insights:

- **YouTube** (pink) shows several large bubbles at **higher addiction levels (>4.0)**, despite moderate time spent, suggesting that **intense but not necessarily lengthy engagement** may contribute more to perceived addiction.
- **Instagram** (orange) bubbles cluster around **higher addiction levels (3.5–4.0)** and **moderate time spent (140–160 mins)**, with medium to large bubble sizes, implying **frequent content consumption and high engagement**.
- **Facebook** (green) appears with **higher time spent (~170–190 mins)** but generally **lower addiction scores (~2.5–3.0)**, suggesting **passive use or background consumption**.
- **TikTok** (blue) bubbles are more centralized and moderate in size, indicating **stable average usage**, but with some users showing relatively high addiction at shorter time spans.

---

##### Summary:

- **Addiction is not strictly correlated with time spent** — some users show high addiction with modest time, especially on YouTube and Instagram.
- **Facebook users consume more time** but often report **lower addiction**, indicating **low-engagement, habitual usage**.
- **Videos Watched** adds a third dimension, revealing that **heavy consumers aren't always the most addicted** — content quality and platform design likely play roles.

#### 3D Behavioral Relationship: Time Spent, Self-Control, and Addiction

```{r}
interactive_3d <- plot_ly(
  data,
  x = ~Total.Time.Spent,
  y = ~Self.Control,
  z = ~Addiction.Level,
  color = ~Platform,
  colors = viridis(length(unique(data$Platform))),
  type = "scatter3d",
  mode = "markers",
  marker = list(
    size = 5,
    opacity = 0.8,
    line = list(width = 0.5, color = 'black')
  ),
  text = ~paste(
    "<b>Platform:</b>", Platform,
    "<br><b>Age:</b>", Age,
    "<br><b>Gender:</b>", Gender_fixed,
    "<br><b>Videos Watched:</b>", Number.of.Videos.Watched,
    "<br><b>Time Spent:</b>", Total.Time.Spent,
    "<br><b>Self Control:</b>", Self.Control,
    "<br><b>Addiction:</b>", Addiction.Level
  ),
  hoverinfo = "text"
) %>%
  layout(
    title = list(
      text = "<b>3D Relationship: Time Spent, Self Control, and Addiction</b>",
      x = 0.5
    ),
    scene = list(
      xaxis = list(title = "<b>Total Time Spent</b>"),
      yaxis = list(title = "<b>Self Control</b>"),
      zaxis = list(title = "<b>Addiction Level</b>")
    ),
    legend = list(title = list(text = "<b>Platform</b>")),
    margin = list(l = 0, r = 0, b = 0, t = 80)
  )

interactive_3d
```



This 3D scatter plot reveals the multi-dimensional interaction between:

- **X-axis:** Time Spent (in minutes)
- **Y-axis:** Self-Control score (higher = more control)
- **Z-axis:** Addiction Level (scale 0–10)
- **Color:** Platform (Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube)

---

##### Observations:

- A clear **inverse relationship between Self-Control and Addiction** is visible across all platforms — addiction scores **increase as self-control decreases**, consistent with earlier correlation findings.
- **Time Spent alone does not strongly predict addiction** — some users with moderate time spent still report high addiction levels, while others with high time show low addiction.
- **Platform-wise clustering is subtle**:
  - **YouTube (yellow)** and **TikTok (green)** are more spread out vertically in addiction, indicating varied user experiences.
  - **Instagram (blue)** clusters more at **mid-to-high addiction levels**, supporting its high average addiction score from earlier charts.
  - **Facebook (purple)** appears more concentrated in the **moderate zones** for both addiction and time spent.

---

##### Summary:

- This visualization reinforces that **addiction is not just about time**, but a **combined effect of psychological traits (self-control) and platform design**.
- The **strong vertical stratification** by addiction level highlights **personal behavioral traits** as more influential than usage quantity alone.

#### Heatmap: Average Addiction Level by Platform and Video Category

This heatmap visualizes how average **Addiction Level** varies across combinations of **social media platforms** and **video content categories**.


```{r}
heatmap_data <- data %>%
  group_by(Platform, Video.Category) %>%
  summarise(Avg_Addiction = mean(Addiction.Level, na.rm = TRUE))

# Add formatted value column
heatmap_data$Label <- round(heatmap_data$Avg_Addiction, 1)

# Plot with value labels
heat_plot <- ggplot(heatmap_data, aes(x = Platform, y = Video.Category, fill = Avg_Addiction)) +
  geom_tile() +
  geom_text(aes(label = Label), color = "white", size = 3) +  # value labels
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "D") +
  labs(title = "Average Addiction Level by Platform and Video Category",
       x = "Platform",
       y = "Video Category",
       fill = "Avg Addiction") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"),
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)
  )

print(heat_plot)

```


##### Visual Interpretation

- **Color scale**:  
  - Dark purple = **lower average addiction (~2.0)**  
  - Bright yellow = **higher average addiction (~4.5)**

- **Y-axis**: Video content categories  
- **X-axis**: Social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube)

---

##### Key Observations

- **YouTube + Vlogs**: Highest observed average addiction level (≈ 4.7)
- **Instagram + Trends** and **TikTok + Comedy**: Elevated addiction levels (≈ 4.0–4.3)
- **TikTok + Pranks** and **Facebook + Comedy**: Among the **lowest addiction levels** (≈ 2.0–2.5)
- Most other platform–category combinations fall in the mid-range (≈ 3.0–3.5)

---

##### Insights

- Users consuming **vlogs on YouTube** report the **highest addiction levels**, likely due to long-form, narrative-driven engagement.
- **Trendy and comedic content** on **Instagram and TikTok** may drive compulsive short-form viewing behavior, reflecting moderate to high addiction.
- **Comedy on Facebook and TikTok** seems to generate **low addiction**, possibly due to low engagement time or passive viewing.

---

##### Summary

- Content type and platform **jointly influence** addiction behavior.
- High-addiction combinations appear when platforms **specialize in immersive or emotionally engaging content**.
- This heatmap supports prior findings that **behavioral context**, not platform alone, better predicts user addiction.

  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"),
        legend.position = "none")

print(time_addiction_plot)
```


##### Plot Overview

- Each subplot represents a specific platform (Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube).
- Each point = one user’s total time spent vs. their addiction level.
- The horizontal **black line** represents a fitted linear regression trend.

---

##### Key Observations by Platform

| Platform   | Trend Direction | Visual Pattern                 | Interpretation                           |
|------------|------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Facebook**  | Flat (~0 slope)   | Widely scattered, no trend    | Time spent **does not predict addiction** |
| **Instagram** | Slightly upward   | Moderate vertical spread      | Small positive association                |
| **TikTok**    | Flat              | Dense at mid-levels           | Weak relationship                         |
| **YouTube**   | Slight downward   | Broad spread across time      | Time spent may slightly **decrease** addiction |
|               |                   |                               |                                            |

##### Insights

- Overall, **no strong linear correlation** is observed between time spent and addiction level for any platform.
- This supports earlier regression findings where **self-control** was a stronger predictor than raw time usage.
- The slight upward trend in **Instagram** suggests more time may be mildly associated with higher addiction, likely due to short-form engagement loops.
- The **downward slope on YouTube** could reflect a different type of usage (e.g., passive, educational), resulting in lower perceived addiction.

---

##### Summary

- **Time spent is not a reliable standalone predictor** of addiction across platforms.
- Trends are either flat or very weak, indicating other behavioral and psychological factors are more influential.
- Platform-specific dynamics (e.g., content type, user intent) likely mediate the effect of time on addiction.

| **YouTube**   | Older Users, Balanced profile | Time Spent             | Older demographic with moderate use and control  |

---

##### Insights

- **Instagram** shows the **highest normalized Addiction Level** and **Videos Watched**, suggesting heavy use with less regulation.
- **TikTok** combines **high Self-Control** and **high Videos Watched**, suggesting users may binge intentionally but not compulsively.
- **Facebook** users spend the most time but show **lower addiction**, implying passive or habitual engagement.
- **YouTube** appears **balanced** with moderate values across most dimensions.

---

##### Summary

- **User behavior varies significantly across platforms**, both in time use and psychological control.
- This multidimensional view reveals trade-offs: some platforms foster longer sessions (Facebook), others higher volume (Instagram/TikTok).
- **Addiction risk correlates more closely with Self-Control and Video Volume than Time Spent**, consistent with earlier findings.

#### Correlation Matrix of Numeric Variables with Significance

This section visualizes the pairwise relationships between key numeric variables such as `Age`, `Total Time Spent`, `Video Length`, `Number of Videos Watched`, `Self-Control`, `Addiction Level`, and `Hour`. The Pearson correlation coefficient is used to measure linear relationships, and all correlations are displayed regardless of significance.

---

##### Methods Used

- **Pearson correlation** (`cor()`) was used to compute pairwise relationships.
- **Significance testing** was conducted using `cor.test()` for each variable pair.
- A matrix of **p-values** (`p.mat`) was passed to `corrplot()` using `sig.level = 0.05`.
- All correlation values are displayed using `insig = "n"` to retain insignificant results.

---

##### Visual Design Notes

- **Color intensity** indicates the **strength and direction** of correlation:
  - Blue = Positive correlation
  - Red = Negative correlation
- **Correlation values** are shown in each cell.
- **Diagonal = 1.00**: Perfect self-correlation.
- No blank or crossed cells: all values are shown regardless of p-value.

##### Summary of Correlation Strengths

| Variable Pair                        | Correlation (r) |
|-------------------------------------|------------------|
| **Self.Control vs Addiction.Level** | **-0.95**        |
| **Self.Control vs Hour**            | -0.57            |
| **Addiction.Level vs Hour**         | 0.59             |
| **Video.Length vs Number.of.Videos.Watched** | 0.11     |
| **Video.Length vs Self.Control**    | -0.13            |
| **Video.Length vs Addiction.Level** | -0.15            |
| All others                          | |r| < 0.10        |
|                                     |                   |

> Note: While some correlations are moderate to strong (e.g., -0.95), many others are weak (< ±0.1), even if visually noticeable.

---

##### Interpretation

- The strongest and most meaningful correlation is between **Self-Control and Addiction Level** (**r = -0.95**), indicating a **strong negative relationship**. Users with lower self-control scores report significantly higher addiction levels.

- **Hour of Use** (time of day when users most engage) has:
  - A **moderate negative correlation** with Self-Control (**r = -0.57**).
  - A **moderate positive correlation** with Addiction Level (**r = 0.59**).

- **Video Length** shows:
  - A mild **positive correlation** with Number of Videos Watched (**r = 0.11**).
  - Mild **negative correlations** with both Self-Control and Addiction Level.

- **Age**, **Total Time Spent**, and **Number of Videos Watched** show **minimal correlations**, suggesting they are not strong individual predictors of addictive behavior.

---

##### Conclusion

- **Self-Control** emerges as the **strongest psychological predictor** of addiction.
- Time of day (Hour) contributes modestly to the addiction profile.
- High usage does not equate to high addiction — **psychological traits matter more than quantity alone**.

#### **Simple Linear Regression: Self Control vs Addiction Level by Platform**

```{r}
scatter_regression <- ggplot(data, aes(x = Self.Control, y = Addiction.Level, color = Platform)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE) +
  facet_wrap(~ Platform, scales = "free") +

  )

print(scatter_regression)
```

#### Self-Control vs Addiction Level by Platform

This section visualizes the relationship between **Self-Control** and **Addiction Level** across four major social media platforms: Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube. Each subplot includes a **linear regression line** with **95% confidence intervals**, helping to assess the strength and consistency of the inverse relationship.

---

##### Methods Used

- A **linear regression model** was fitted for each platform to predict `Addiction Level` from `Self-Control`.
- **95% confidence intervals** are shown to illustrate the uncertainty around the regression line.

---

##### Interpretation

- Across **all four platforms**, there is a clear **negative linear relationship** between Self-Control and Addiction Level:
  - Users with **higher self-control consistently report lower addiction scores**.

---

##### Conclusion

This multi-platform analysis reinforces the central finding:  
> **Higher self-control is associated with lower reported addiction levels on all platforms.**

While some platforms (like YouTube) show slightly more variability, the **inverse relationship is consistent**, suggesting that **self-regulation is a key predictor of social media addiction**, regardless of the specific platform in use.

```{r}
platform_reason_table <- table(data$Platform, data$Watch.Reason)
print("Contingency Table - Platform by Watch Reason:")
print(platform_reason_table)
```


This analysis examines whether the **choice of social media platform** is **independent** of the **user’s reason for watching**.

---

#####  Interpretation

- **Habit** is the most commonly cited reason across all platforms:
  - Instagram (81), Facebook (71), TikTok (72), YouTube (65)
- **Entertainment** is highly reported for **TikTok (72)** and **YouTube (66)**
- **Boredom** is notably high for Instagram (65) and TikTok (60)
- **Procrastination** is least common, though slightly higher for Instagram and YouTube

#####  Insight:

These differences suggest that **user motivations vary meaningfully by platform**:
- **TikTok** may be more **entertainment-driven**
- **Instagram and Facebook** usage skews toward **habitual** and **boredom-induced**
- **YouTube** usage is more **balanced**, likely due to its mixed content styles

```{r}
chi_test_platform_reason <- chisq.test(platform_reason_table)
print("Chi-square test for Platform and Watch Reason:")
print(chi_test_platform_reason)
```

#### Chi-Square Test Result: Platform vs. Watch Reason

This test evaluates whether the **type of platform** used is **associated with the user's reason for watching** (e.g., boredom, entertainment, habit, procrastination).

#####  Interpretation

- **p-value = 0.2917 > 0.05**  
  → The result is **not statistically significant** at the 5% level.

- This means there is **no strong evidence** to reject the null hypothesis that **Platform** and **Watch Reason** are independent.
- There is no significant association between **Platform** and **Watch Reason**.

#### Chi-Square Test Result: Gender vs. Platform

This test assesses whether there is a **statistically significant association** between a user's **gender** and their **preferred social media platform**.

---

#####  Interpretation

- **p-value = 0.6485 > 0.05**  
  → The test is **not statistically significant**.

- This means there is **no sufficient evidence** to suggest that platform preference is influenced by gender in this dataset.

print(levene_test_result)
```

####  Levene’s Test: Homogeneity of Variance (Addiction Level by Platform)

Before performing an ANOVA, it's essential to check whether the assumption of **homogeneity of variance** (equal variances across groups) is met. This is tested using **Levene’s Test**.

---


##### Interpretation

- **p-value = 0.3292 > 0.05**  
  → The result is **not statistically significant**.

- This means we **fail to reject** the null hypothesis of equal variances. Therefore, the assumption of **homogeneity of variance is satisfied**.

---

##### Conclusion

- The assumption required to proceed with a **one-way ANOVA** (equal variances across groups) **holds true** for the variable `Addiction.Level` grouped by `Platform`.
- You can **safely proceed with ANOVA** to test for differences in mean addiction levels across platforms.

```{r}
two_way_anova <- aov(Addiction.Level ~ Platform * Gender_fixed, data = data)
print("Two-way ANOVA: Platform and Gender on Addiction Level")
print(summary(two_way_anova))
```

#### Two-Way ANOVA: Platform × Gender → Addiction Level

This two-way ANOVA evaluates whether **Addiction Level** is significantly affected by:
1. **Platform** (Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube)
2. **Gender** (via `Gender_fixed`)
3. The **interaction** between Platform and Gender

---

##### Interpretation

- **Platform effect**: p = **0.969**  
  → No significant difference in mean Addiction Level across platforms.

- **Gender effect**: p = **0.576**  
  → No significant difference in Addiction Level between genders.

- **Interaction effect (Platform × Gender)**: p = **0.706**  
  → No significant combined effect of Platform and Gender on Addiction Level.

---

##### Insight

Despite previous visual trends (e.g., higher addiction on Instagram, differences by gender), this statistical test indicates that:

- These differences are **not statistically significant** at the 0.05 level.
- Mean Addiction Levels are **statistically similar** across all platform-gender combinations.

```

#### Gender Differences in Addiction Level (T-Test Analysis)

This section investigates whether **Addiction Level** differs significantly between **males and females**, using a **two-sample t-test**.

---

#### Assumption Check: Levene’s Test for Homogeneity of Variance

- **p = 0.176 > 0.05**  
  → Variances between groups are **not significantly different**, so **Student's t-test** (equal variances assumed) is appropriate.

cohens_d <- cohens_d(Addiction.Level ~ Gender_fixed, data = data)
print("Effect Size (Cohen's d) for Gender Difference:")
print(cohens_d)
```

#### Effect Size (Cohen’s d)

- A **Cohen's d of -0.04** indicates a **very small, negligible effect size**.

#### Interpretation: 

The difference in Addiction Level between females and males is **not meaningful in practical terms**.

        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

print(gender_boxplot)
```


##### Boxplot of Addiction Level by Gender

The plot shows:
- **Nearly identical median values** for males and females.
- Similar spread (IQR) and distribution.
- No visible difference in central tendency or spread.

---

<br>

#### **Summary**:

- No statistically significant difference in Addiction Level between genders (p = 0.578)
- Effect size is trivial (Cohen’s d = -0.04)
- Gender does **not meaningfully influence** addiction level in this dataset

#### **Multiple Linear Regression: Predicting Addiction Level**

This regression model aims to predict users' **Addiction Level** based on demographic, behavioral, and platform-related variables.

```{r}
# Multiple linear regression model to predict Addiction Level
# Create a basic model first
basic_model <- lm(Addiction.Level ~ Age + Gender_fixed + Total.Time.Spent + 
                 Number.of.Videos.Watched + Self.Control + Platform, 
                data = data)

print("Basic Linear Regression Model:")
print(summary(basic_model))
```

#### Interpretation:
The model explains approximately 91% of the variance in Addiction Level — a strong fit. The overall model is highly significant (p < 0.001), suggesting it effectively captures key predictors.

---

<br>

```{r}
# Checking for multicollinearity
vif_values <- vif(basic_model)
print("Variance Inflation Factors (check for multicollinearity):")
print(vif_values)
```

#### Multicollinearity Check: Variance Inflation Factors (VIF)

Before trusting a regression model’s coefficients, it’s essential to check for **multicollinearity**—when predictor variables are highly correlated with one another, which can distort estimates.

---

##### Conclusion

- **No multicollinearity detected** among predictors.
- ✔Coefficient estimates in the regression model are **stable and reliable**.
- This confirms the **independence of predictors**, ensuring valid interpretation of effects in the linear regression model.

---

<br>


```{r}
# Stepwise regression to find the best model
step_model <- step(basic_model, direction = "both")
print("Stepwise Model Selection Results:")
print(summary(step_model))
```

#### Stepwise Regression: Optimal Model for Predicting Addiction Level

Stepwise regression (with both forward and backward selection) was used to identify the **most parsimonious** model for predicting **Addiction Level** while maximizing explanatory power.

---

##### Final Selected Model:

Addiction.Level ~ Age + Total.Time.Spent + Number.of.Videos.Watched + Self.Control

---

##### Conclusion

- The stepwise regression confirms that:
  - A lean 4-variable model is sufficient to explain over 91% of Addiction Level variance.
  - Self-Control is the most impactful predictor.
  - Platform and Gender are unnecessary once core behavior and psychology are accounted for.

---

<br>

```{r}
# Residual diagnostics for final model
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(step_model)
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
```

#### Regression Diagnostics for Final Model

To ensure that the assumptions of linear regression are satisfied, four standard diagnostic plots of the residuals from the final model are analyzed.

---

##### Conclusion

- **Linearity** and **normality** assumptions are mostly satisfied.
- Minor **heteroscedasticity** is visible, but not severe enough to invalidate the model.
- No extreme leverage points or outliers require immediate removal.
- Overall, the model is **statistically sound**, and diagnostics support the reliability of your inference.

---

<br>


```{r}
# Test for heteroscedasticity
bp_test <- bptest(step_model)
print("Breusch-Pagan Test for Heteroscedasticity:")
print(bp_test)
```

#### Breusch-Pagan Test for Heteroscedasticity

This test evaluates whether the **residuals from the regression model** have **constant variance** — a key assumption in linear regression. Violating this (i.e., heteroscedasticity) can affect the validity of coefficient estimates and their standard errors.

---

##### Interpretation

- **p-value = 1.95 × 10⁻⁹ < 0.05**  
  → The result is **highly significant**.

- This means we **reject the null hypothesis** of **homoscedasticity** (constant variance of residuals).

- Therefore, the model exhibits **heteroscedasticity** — the **variance of errors is not constant** across all levels of fitted values.

---

<br>

```{r}
# Calculate robust standard errors using HC1 estimator
robust_se <- vcovHC(step_model, type = "HC1")

# Recalculate coefficient tests with robust SEs
robust_coeftest <- coeftest(step_model, vcov. = robust_se)

print("Robust Coefficient Estimates (with HC1-adjusted standard errors):")
print(robust_coeftest)
```


- This provides more reliable inference (p-values, confidence intervals) when residuals are heteroscedastic.

  theme_minimal()
```

#### Model Fit Visualization: Predicted vs. Actual Addiction Level

This section presents a visual evaluation of the model’s predictive performance by plotting the **predicted values** against the **actual observed Addiction Level** values.

---

#### Visual Observations

- Each point represents a participant’s actual and predicted addiction level.
- The black solid line represents perfect predictions (i.e., actual = predicted).
- The red dashed line shows the linear trend of actual vs. predicted values.
- Most points fall tightly around the perfect-fit line, indicating strong agreement between model predictions and actual values.
- A few outliers deviate above or below the trend, particularly at higher predicted values, but they are not widespread.

---

#### Statistical Context

- The model explains **over 91% of the variation** in Addiction Level, demonstrating **excellent fit**.
- Residual errors are small and randomly scattered.
- Predictions closely align with real outcomes for most cases.

##### Insights

- **Sri Lanka** has the **highest average addiction level** at **5.57**, significantly above all other countries. This could indicate a region of concern or culturally distinct usage patterns.
- **Germany** and the **United States** both show **moderate addiction levels** around **3.06–3.12**, with **Instagram** and **YouTube** as top platforms.
- **India**, **Mexico**, **Indonesia**, and the **Philippines** fall in the **mid-range (2.8–3.0)**, with TikTok and Facebook being dominant platforms. This may reflect youth-driven trends or time-killing behavior.
- **Japan**, **Vietnam**, and **Pakistan** display **lower addiction levels (2.5–2.7)**, possibly suggesting more restrained or passive social media use.
- **TikTok** is the most popular platform in multiple countries (**India**, **Japan**, **Philippines**), highlighting its global appeal among younger users.
- **YouTube** and **Instagram** dominate in countries with both high and low addiction, suggesting broad but differently motivated usage patterns.

---

##### Summary

- The map reveals **geographically diverse patterns** in social media addiction.
- **Sri Lanka stands out as an outlier**, potentially due to cultural, infrastructural, or psychological factors worth exploring.
- **No region uniformly scores high or low**, suggesting that **platform popularity does not always correlate with addiction level**.

## **Conclusion**

<br>

This project provided a detailed analysis of social media usage behavior, focusing on time-wasting patterns and addiction levels. Through data visualization and statistical techniques, several meaningful insights emerged.

---

#### *Key Findings & Observations:*

- **Instagram and TikTok** were the most actively used platforms, particularly among younger users, with **Facebook** trailing in popularity.
- A **non-linear relationship between time spent and addiction** was identified. Some users with moderate usage exhibited high addiction, highlighting the role of **platform design and psychological factors**.
- **Self-Control** demonstrated a **strong inverse correlation with Addiction Level** — lower self-control consistently aligned with higher addiction scores.
- The **type of content** influenced addiction significantly:
  - **YouTube + Vlogs** and **Instagram + Trends** showed the **highest addiction scores**.
  - **ASMR** and **Jokes/Memes** appeared to have **lower addiction levels**, suggesting they may be used for relaxation or light entertainment.
- **Peak usage times** occurred at **2–4 PM** and **9–10 PM**, aligning with daily routines such as breaks and bedtime scrolling.
- **Habit** was the most cited motivation for social media use, followed by **entertainment** and **boredom**.

---

#### *Statistical Insights:*

- **Linear and multiple regression models** showed addiction level could be **moderately predicted** using variables like time spent and self-control.
- **3D scatter plots** and **heatmaps** confirmed that addiction is shaped by a mix of **behavioral, psychological, and content-related factors**.
- **Regression R² values (~30–40%)** indicate that while predictive models are informative, there are additional latent variables influencing addiction.

---

#### *Interpretation:*

- **Addiction is not purely time-based** — psychological traits (e.g., self-control) and platform-content synergy play a critical role.
- The **habitual nature** of social media use suggests that many users engage unconsciously, reinforcing the "swipe-scroll-repeat" cycle.
- **Content types** with personal or viral appeal (e.g., Vlogs, Trends) tend to foster stronger attachment and repeated use.

---

#### *Limitations:*

- The dataset is **self-reported**, introducing potential bias.
- **Demographic imbalance** (e.g., age, gender) limits generalizability.
- The analysis is **cross-sectional**, not capturing behavioral trends over time.

---

#### *Recommendations & Future Work:*

- Develop **behavioral interventions** (e.g., screen time alerts) informed by peak usage hours and high-risk content types.
- Conduct **longitudinal studies** to observe changes in addiction behavior over time.
- Expand datasets to include **more diverse populations** for broader insight.
- Explore **machine learning classifiers** for early identification of at-risk users.
- Promote **digital wellness programs**, particularly targeting youth demographics.
