# 📊 Swipe-Scroll-Repeat: Behavioral Insights into Social Media Use and Its Addictive Patterns

###  This project investigates the relationships between social media usage, behavioral patterns, and signs of addiction among individuals. Using statistical methods in R, we explore correlations, regressions, and hypothesis testing to extract meaningful insights from survey data.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Group 4.Rmd` — R Markdown file with code and analysis
- `Group-4.html` — Rendered output with visualizations and interpretations

---

## 🧠 Objectives

- Understand the impact of social media usage on behavioral traits.
- Analyze if gender influences addiction tendencies.
- Identify correlations between variables such as frequency of use, number of platforms, and emotional outcomes.

---

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains self-reported responses regarding:

- Number of hours spent on social media
- Number of platforms used
- Behavioral changes (e.g., mood swings, loneliness)
- Demographics (e.g., gender)
- Indicators of social media addiction

---

## 🧪 Methodology

We used **R** for data analysis, applying the following techniques:

- **Correlation Analysis**: To assess linear and monotonic relationships between variables (Pearson and Spearman).
- **Chi-Square Tests**: To evaluate independence between categorical variables (e.g., gender vs. addiction).
- **McNemar's Test**: For paired nominal data comparison.
- **Linear and Multiple Regression**: To identify predictors of social media addiction and behavior scores.
- **Visualizations**: Including scatter plots, regression lines, and boxplots for enhanced interpretation.

## 📈 Key Findings

- A significant positive correlation exists between time spent on social media and behavioral changes.
- Gender was found to be significantly associated with social media addiction in chi-square tests.
- Regression models show that both the number of platforms and hours spent are strong predictors of addiction symptoms.
- Spearman correlation highlighted monotonic trends in emotional impact metrics.

## 📚 Tools Used

- R
- R Markdown
- `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `psych`, `car`, `MASS` libraries

## 📎 How to Use

To replicate this analysis:

1. Open `Group 4.Rmd` in RStudio.
2. Install required R packages if not already available.
3. Knit the file to HTML or run sections manually to view outputs and plots.
